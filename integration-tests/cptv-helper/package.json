    "description": "cptv helper is a webserver that accepts cptv config descriptions and returns valid cptv test files to cypress.  It exists as a work-around because at this time cypress cannot directly import wasm files.  If that limitation goes away in the future, then the cptv-encoder should be directly imported into the test command",
